I am using python 2.7
run this to get the ngrams model log probabilities:
	ngrams train.txt -test test.txt
run this to get the sentence generated:
	ngrams train.txt -gen seeds.txt
I have tested the code on CADE labe l25 machine
Though please make sure the paths are correct and all the required files are in the required path.
Thanks
